1. install latest version of Git on your computer

2. log into your gitHub account with your usma email via this link
    <https://github.com/enterprises/westpoint-emu>

3. Make note of your username! mine is @git-it-gurl

4.  a) In VS code install the "GitHub Pull Requests" extension

    b) In the file explorer navigate to 
    the directory on your computer where you would like to 
    clone the repository files. I reccomend NOT using OneDrive
    it can cause weird authentication errors.

5. Open a terminal in VS Code and execute 
the following lines with your GitHub information filled in:
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

    mine looked like:
    git config --global user.name "git-it-gurl"
    git config --global user.email "kathryn.dula@westpoint.edu"

6. click on the person icon in the lower left-hand corner and select:
    "Sign into GitHub"

7. On GitHub create a repository and copy the HTTPS link
    (found when you click on the GREEN code drop down menu)

8.  a) navigate to the SAME folder in your terminal 
    that you did in the VS code file explorer in step 4.b)

    b) Once you have that copied to your clipboard,
     go back to VS Code and type the following into your terminal:
    git clone <copied url>

    mine looked like:
    git clone https://github.com/git-it-gurl/capstone_test.git

9. Then you should see all the files of the repo population in your file explorer in VSCode!

10. create a new jupyter file. (test.ipynb) and write some code in it!

11. a) navigate into your repo folder in the terminal:
        cd C:\Users\kathryn.dula\Documents\capstone\capstone_test
    b) In your terminal type:
        git add .
        git commit -m "<insert comments on the work you have done>"
        git push

12. Everytime you make ANY chnages on your laptop you MUST run through
    these 3 commands to PUSH all your changes to the REMOTE repository stored on GitHub servers
    so that your team can see them.

13. Everytime you start a new coding session PULL down chnages made by your team from the GitHub remote repositort
    onto your local laptop, so that you're working on the most-recent version of the code.
    To do this executue the following command:
        git pull
